# Lyricker
Adding lyrics is tedious. This program makes it only half as tedious.

Procedure:
  1. If you haven't, watch Aren's video on adding lyrics (in Moonscraper) https://youtu.be/C1sLKoph4lU 
  2. Add empty lyric events in Moonscraper (Add one, then copy-paste the rest to do it faster)
  3. Add phrase_start and phrase_end events in Moonscraper
  3. In the program, click on the "set" button and find you chart file (remember to back up the file just in case)
  4. Copy-paste the lyrics from a lyrics website into the large text box (or just write the lyrics)
  5. Split up the words into syllables using a dash (e.g. this is a sen-tence)
  6. Click the button "Write lyrics"
  7. ???
  8. Lyrics
