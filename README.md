# Lyricker
Adding lyrics is tedious. This program makes it only half as tedious.

Procedure:
  1. If you haven't already, watch Aren's video on adding lyrics (in Moonscraper) https://youtu.be/C1sLKoph4lU 
  2. Add empty lyric events in Moonscraper (Add one, then copy-paste the rest to do it faster)
  3. In the program, click on the "set" button and find you .chart file (please back up the file just in case)
  4. Copy-paste the lyrics from a lyrics website into the large text box (or just write the lyrics)
  5. Split up the text into phrases using a period followed by a space (e.g. This is phrase 1. This is phrase 2.)
  6. Split up the words into syllables using a dash (e.g. this is a sen-tence)
  7. Click the button "Write lyrics"
  8. ???
  9. Lyrics
